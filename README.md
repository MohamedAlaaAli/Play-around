<h3 style="color: grey; opacity:0.90;">Statement:<br>In this task, you are required to list as many solutions as possible to the Fibonacci sequence problem. "given an integer n, output the nth Fibonacci number"
Explain the algorithm of each solution mentioning the space and time complexity.<h3>

  <p>What is <strong>Fibonacci</strong> Number?
A Fibonacci number is a series of numbers in which each Fibonacci number is obtained by adding the two preceding numbers. It means that the next number in the series is the addition of two previous numbers. Let the first two numbers in the series be taken as 0 and 1. By adding 0 and 1, we get the third number as 1. Then by adding the second and the third number (i.e) 1 and 1, we get the fourth number as 2, and similarly, the process goes on. Thus, we get the Fibonacci series as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ……. Hence, the obtained series is called the Fibonacci number series.

We can also obtain the Fibonacci numbers from the pascal’s triangle as shown in the below figure <p>

<br><p>Fibonacci Numbers Formula
The sequence of Fibonacci numbers can be defined as:

F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>

Where F<sub>n</sub> is the nth term or number
  
  yarap

F<sub>n-1</sub> is the (n-1)th term

F<sub>n-2</sub> is the (n-2)th term

From the equation, we can summarize the definition as, the next number in the sequence, is the sum of the previous two numbers present in the sequence, starting from 0 and 1. Let us create a table to find the next term of the Fibonacci sequence, using the formula.<p><br>

| F<sub>n-1</sub>  | F<sub>n-2</sub>  |  F<sub>n</sub> |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| 0 | 1   | 1   |
| 1 | 1   | 2   |
| 1 | 2   | 3   |
| 2 | 3   | 5   |
| 3 | 5   | 8  |
